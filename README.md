# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of linear regression using Python. It includes a custom-built linear regression model and provides sample datasets for testing and evaluation.

## Features

* **Custom Linear Regression Implementation**: Understand the fundamentals by building a linear regression model from scratch without relying on external machine learning libraries.
* **Sample Datasets**: Includes CSV files (`linTest.csv`, `r2test.csv`, `test2.csv`) to test and validate the model.
* **Project Files**: Contains Python script (`LinearReg.py`) and project files (`LinearReg.pyproj`, `LinearReg.sln`) for structured development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* Basic understanding of Python programming and linear regression concepts.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BYT18/Linear-Regression-.git
   cd Linear-Regression-
   ```

2. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python LinearReg.py
   ```

   Ensure that the required CSV files are in the same directory as the script.

## Project Structure

```
Linear-Regression-/
├── LinearReg.py           # Main Python script with linear regression implementation
├── LinearReg.pyproj       # Python project file
├── LinearReg.sln          # Solution file for IDEs like Visual Studio
├── linTest.csv            # Sample dataset 1
├── r2test.csv             # Sample dataset 2
└── test2.csv              # Sample dataset 3
```

## Usage

The `LinearReg.py` script reads data from the provided CSV files, fits a linear regression model, and outputs the results, including coefficients and evaluation metrics.
